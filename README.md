This project was created as part of a FinTech exam.
The assignment explores how cryptocurrency portfolio performance changes as the number of assets in the portfolio increases.

The project includes:

Collecting two years of daily price data for the top 25 cryptocurrencies

Random portfolio construction

Simulation of thousands of portfolios

Calculation of return, volatility, and Sharpe ratio

Visualization and interpretation of results

The goal is to understand diversification effects in crypto portfolios and to compare findings with insights from DeMiguel et al. (2009) regarding naive 1/N portfolio strategies.
